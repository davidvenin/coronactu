This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

## Method and tools - The Keep it simple way

I created this project with my base starter using all the followings 

- Prettier / ESLint : keep my code clean
- Husky / Lint Staged : because I don't want to lose time working on my commits
- SWR : Thanks to Vercel team, we don't need to care that much on getting data from api, handling errors, loading...
- Typescript : interface, typings, models, enum... I know what I want, where it comes from and how It'll be.
- [Algolia Places](https://github.com/algolia/places) : to look for country code
- SWR : to work with async stuff
- Tailwindcss
- Formik : to handle form
- With Love and Passion
